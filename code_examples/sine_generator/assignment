Generating Sine Wave Using Regressional Neural Network

1.	Generate a simple sine wave without noise
2.	Train neural network to learn sine wave 
3.	Get accuracy results without noise
4.	Investigate the effect of input noise to accuracy
5.  Train with noisy data

The neural network types to be used
o	FCN with two layers   (change neuron size and report)
o	FCN with three layers (change neuron size and report)
o	1D CNN
o	RNN
o	GRU
o	LSTM	

Note: Put only training accuracy

Create a flow chart for all the codes
Create report for the results
Explain where did you stuck and how did you overcome
Write how all the nueral networks work
Write simple and neat code with comments in every line
Do Not Use complete code from the internet, you should write your code
Animation for training can be added afterwards
