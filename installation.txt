Basic installation for environment

Anaconda 3.7 installation
  https://www.anaconda.com/
  
  for windows control if path variable is correct C:\Users\Halil\Anaconda3 and C:\Users\Halil\Anaconda3\Scripts
  
  before installing python check if "conda activate base" is working or not
  
  check python is working or not by writing "python" to command prompt (cmd), you should see python interactive shell and anaconda version on the screen, write exit() to quit
  
Visual Studio Code installation
  https://code.visualstudio.com/
  
  visual studio code is used as the ide, any other ide can be used but vs code is preferred
  
  after installation, to change terminal from powershell to cmd, first press ctrl + shift + k then 
  click "Terminal: Select Default Shell", lastly click "Command Prompt"
  
  reopen the terminal from the terminal tab
  
Pytorch Installation
  https://pytorch.org/
  
  Note: If you want to use cuda, before installing pytorch first install graphic card drivers, then install cuda
  https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
  
  if pytorch installation is not working, make sure you are using right virtual environment
  
  After pytorch installation, run python on cmd or terminal
  
  In the python interactive shell, first run "import torch", then "print(torch.__version__)"this should give 1.2.0 or 1.3.0
  This project is written on 1.2.0, check your pytorch version for compatibility issues
  
  After printing version run "print(torch.cuda.is_available())" if this returns True then your cuda drivers are running correctly and you are good to go, otherwise search online or do the steps all over again

Visual Code Extensions
  Install Python (from Microsoft) and Pytroch Snippets extensions to the VS Code
