  Change the dataset to MNIST
  Change neural network architecture and present the results
  Calculate number of neural network weights
  
Read the reading list :)

Test different neural network architectures using torchvision.
  AlexNet
  VGGNet
  Inception
  ResNet
  SqueezeNet
  DenseNet

After testing these models train neural network on custom dataset. Find different datasets and share them under this section with tab.
  PlantVillage crop disease dataset
  
There are two groups in study one group will study on image dataset and other will use time series data.
Generate sinewave signal and train neural network to predict sinewave or any other signal.
  Use only linear neural networks (Fully Connected or Dense) 
  Use recurrent neural netwokrs (RNN, LSTM, GRU)

Search for timeries dataset, anomaly detection using deep learning.
